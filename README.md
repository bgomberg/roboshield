# Installation

Below are instructions for installing this library with Arduino 1.6.x:

1. Download this repository as a .zip by clicking on the "Download ZIP" button on GitHub.
2. In Arduino, create a new project and go to "Sketch" -> "Include Library" -> "Add .ZIP Library..." and select the .zip you just downloaded.
4. Arduino will automatically import the library and place the proper #include at the top.
5. In the future, you can skip step 1 and simply select the library within the "Sketch" -> "Include Library" list for step 2.
